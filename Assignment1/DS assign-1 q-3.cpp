 3) Predict the Output of the following program
    int main()
    {
    int i;
    int arr[5] = {1};
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    printf("%d",arr[i]);
    return 0;
    }
*/

/*

Output: 10000
Explanation: The array is initialized with the first element as 1 and the rest as 0.
The loop prints each element of the array, resulting in "10000".
